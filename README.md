# 100 Days of Code - Course Projects

This repository contains all the projects I have completed during [Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller's 100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code-web-development-bootcamp/) course. Each project is built according to the course requirements and focuses on specific concepts or skills introduced in the corresponding section.

### Notes:
- Some projects may **not be fully responsive** or may **lack certain functionalities**, as they are designed to follow the course guidelines.  
- If I make any changes or improvements beyond the original requirements, these updates will be clearly specified in the corresponding project's folder or README.

This repository serves as a learning journey and showcases my progress throughout the course. ðŸ˜Š
