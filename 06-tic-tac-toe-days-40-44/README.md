# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Days 40-44)

This is another project done during the course **100 Days of Code**.
The project will not only follow along with the course code but will also include some of my own custom features and improvements. 

### Custom Features and Modifications (so far)

Below is a list of all the custom features and modifications I have implemented so far:
- Replaced `alert()` with a custom modal (added to `startNewGame()`) and created `closeErrorMsgOverlay()` to close it.
- Implemented logic to check if both players have the same name and added a custom modal to display an error message.
- Implemented smooth scroll to game area when "Start Game" is clicked, using `scrollIntoView()`.

The game is still in progress, but sonn you'll be able to see it. Stay tuned for updates!
