# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Days 40-44)

This is another project done during the course **100 Days of Code**. The game is still in progress, and the basic HTML structure has been set up.

In the upcoming days, I will continue adding features and styling to complete the project. This project will not only follow along with the course code but will also include some of my own custom features and improvements. Stay tuned for updates!
